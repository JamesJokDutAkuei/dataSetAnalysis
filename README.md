# Fuel Efficiency Visualization Project

This project analyzes a dataset of vehicles with a focus on fuel efficiency and environmental impact. Using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, it visualizes key aspects of the data to support AI modeling and decision-making.

## 📊 Features

- **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of combined fuel efficiency (MPG).
- **Heatmap**: Displays correlations among numerical features such as engine displacement, CO2 emissions, and fuel economy scores.
- **Interpretations**: Brief insights provided after each visualization to guide understanding and future model considerations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Files

- `FuelEfficiency_Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing code, plots, and interpretations
- `histogram_comb_efficiency.png` - Histogram image
- `heatmap_correlation.png` - Heatmap image

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open `FuelEfficiency_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run all cells to generate and view plots.

## 📌 Note

Ensure that the `fuel_econ.csv` dataset is in the same directory as the notebook.
